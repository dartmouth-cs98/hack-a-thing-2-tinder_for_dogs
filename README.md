# Tinder4Dogz
By Sean Hawkins and Anna Matusewicz

## How to run
```
cd tinder4dogz
yarn
expo start
```

Open the iOS simulator and enjoy!

## Short description of what we built
We built an app we call Tinder4Dogz, which is modeled off of Tinder but helps people find other dog owners to walk their dogs with. It features a stack of cards of profiles that the user swipes through in order to match with other dog walkers who want to walk with them. It also has a profile page where the user can input their information, which would be displayed to other users. 
## Who did what
Both us of worked on the initial commit that was based off of these tutorials: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDAdY2LkP_U and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmHywzVkKn8. After that, Sean worked on enabling multiple pictures for each card/account and the integration of an additional screen, the profile page. Anna worked on adding in the profile information viewing functionality and dots for photo progress. 
## What we learned
Neither of us had ever worked with React Native before, so we got a good understanding of a new tech stack through doing this project. We also learned a few basics about how to make objects draggable in an app.
## How does this hack-a-thing inspire you or relate to your possible project ideas?
It makes us more confident in creating a phone app for our Senior Design Project. We now have a general sense of what works and what does not work.
## What didnâ€™t work
Adding animations outside of the tutorial proved difficult. We will need to look more into the fundamentals of the animations in the future. Most internet examples utilized absolute positioning which didn't work very well with the existing flex box structure.
