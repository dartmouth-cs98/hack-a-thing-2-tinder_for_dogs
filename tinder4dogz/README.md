# Short description of what we built
We built an app we call Tinder4Dogz, which is modelled off of Tinder but helps people find other dog owners to walk their dogs with. It features a stack of cards of profiles that the user swipes through in order to match with other dog walkers who want to walk with them. It also has a profile page where the user can input their information, which would be displayed to other users. 
# Who did what
Both us of worked on the initial commit that was based off of these tutorials: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDAdY2LkP_U and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmHywzVkKn8. After that, Sean worked on enabling multiple pictures for each card/account and the integration of an additional screen, the profile page. Anna worked on adding in the profile information viewing functionality. 
# What we learned
Neither of us had ever worked with React Native before, so we got a good understanding of a new tech stack through doing this project.
